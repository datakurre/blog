While Robot Framework already comes with a nice <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/robotframework/wiki/QuickStartGuide\">Quick Start\nGuide</a> and\na very comprehensive <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/robotframework/wiki/UserGuide\">User\nGuide</a>, there’s\nstill a lot room for good narratives on getting started with it. So,\nwhen I heard about a new book about Robot Framework, I was quite\nexcited. Unfortunately, <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1bXReXr\">Robot Framework Test\nAutomation</a> (Bisht 2013) appeared not to be the\nbook that I was waiting for.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://bit.ly/1bXReXr\">Robot Framework Test Automation</a> is a new Robot\nFramework book written by Sumit Bisht and published by Packt Publishing\n(Oct 2013). The book gives a nice (short) introduction to acceptance\ntesting in general and a quite ok overview of the features available in\nRobot Framework. After reading the book, you should have a good idea of\nall the things that are possible with Robot Framework, but you might be\nconfused of how all the presented topics are related and how to actually\nuse them in practice.</p>\n<p>While the book is a quick read to get familiar with most of the features\nand concepts in Robot Framework, it’s not a sufficient standalone guide\nfor actually writing any tests with it. For example, the book uses a few\ndifferent Robot Framework syntaxes inconsistently, and only a very few\nexamples are complete (without downloading the bundled source code). In\ngeneral, I would recommend to skip the examples in this book and learn\nthe best practices from the examples in the official <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/robotframework/wiki/UserGuide\">User\nGuide</a> instead.</p>\n<p>However, if you find both the official <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/robotframework/wiki/UserGuide\">User\nGuide</a> and\n<a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/robotframework/wiki/QuickStartGuide\">Quick Start\nGuide</a> too\nintimidating to get started with Robot Framework, you could try this\nbook to learn the concepts and possibilities, and then return to the\nofficial guides for learning the details.</p>\n<p><em>Disclaimer: I got a review copy of the book from Packt.</em></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Review: Robot Framework Test Automation (Bisht 2013)","tags":["Review","Robot Framework","Testing"],"date":"December 08, 2013","published":"2013-12-08 06:00:00"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2013/12/review-robot-framework-test-automation.html/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2013/09/meet-robot-family-for-plone-developers.html/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Meet the Robot family (for Plone developers)"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2014/02/my-week-of-plone-sprinting-with-friends.html/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"My week of Plone sprinting with friends and robots"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
