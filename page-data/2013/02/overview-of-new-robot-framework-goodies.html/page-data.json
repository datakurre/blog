The sprint, however, was great, fun and well\norganized. Thank you Ramon, Timo and <a href=\"iskra.cat/en/\">iskraTIC</a> folks!\nAlso, thanks to my employer, <a href=\"https://www.jyu.fi/en/\">University of\nJyväskylä</a> for allowing and sponsoring me to\nparticipate the sprint.</p>\n<p>In the beginning of the sprint I gave others short introduction on\nwriting functional Selenium test for Plone with <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/robotframework/\">Robot\nFramework</a>. At the end of the\nsprint, I was already learning new robot tricks from them. Thanks\nCarles, Kees, Laura and Víctor. Amazing.</p>\n<p>Oh, the goodies:</p>\n<h2>Tutorials</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://ploneact.readthedocs.org/\">plone.act</a> has now to-the-point\ntutorials for writing robot tests for a new (templer based) or existing\nadd-on.</p>\n<p>They are not reference manuals (yet), but with some good examples they\nshould give you a good start for writing robot tests for Plone.</p>\n<h2>Templer templates</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://pypi.python.org/pypi/templer.plone\">templer.plone</a> (From version\n1.0b4), thanks to Maik Röder, has now a new question for populating the\ncreated product with a functional robot test example.</p>\n<h2>plone.app.testing[robot]</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.app.testing\">plone.app.testing</a> (from\nversion 4.2.2) can now be required in your <code>setup.py</code> with <code>[robot]</code>\nextras to require all the needed dependencies for writing and running\nfunctional Selenium tests for Plone with robot.</p>\n<h2>Robot test server</h2>\n<p><strong>plone.act</strong> repository has included a <strong>secret</strong> development server\ncalled\n<a href=\"http://ploneact.readthedocs.org/en/latest/server.html\">act_server</a>. It\ncan start a temporary Plone site with the given testing layer\nconfigured. Instead of running tests on top if it itself, however, it\njust leaves the site on, and allows you to test it with any tools you\ncan imagine (even with a browser).</p>\n<p>The server was originally written by Godefroid Chapelle for months ago,\nbut we finally managed to finish it to support test isolation with\n<code>pybot</code> — the default test runner installed with Robot Framework.</p>\n<p>So, now <code>act_server</code> makes it possible you to run your unfinished tests\nover and over again with <code>pybot</code> against a real test layer based Plone\nsandbox, with test isolation, but without needing to wait for the\nexpensive test layer setup and teardown.</p>\n<p>It’s awesome.</p>\n<h2>Robot remote library example for Plone</h2>\n<p>In BDD-style tests it should be possible to prepare tests in\n<strong>Given</strong>-clauses, preferably as fast as possible (= without Selenium).</p>\n<p><strong>plone.act</strong> repository contains now an example on, <a href=\"http://ploneact.readthedocs.org/en/latest/remote.html\">how to create a\nrobot remote library in Plone\nsite</a> during test\nlayer setup, populate it with keywords written in Python, and then run\nthose keywords like any other keywords in robot tests.</p>\n<p>Because robot will call those keywords through XML-RPC, you can e.g.\ncreate and delete objects without need to think about transactions or\ncommits by yourself.</p>\n<h2>That’s all</h2>\n<p>No plone.act release? I’m sorry.</p>\n<p>We are not yet sure, if there’ really need for a separate package\n(plone.act), or should the stuff currently in plone.act be moved into\nexisting packages, mainly into\n<a href=\"http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.testing/\">plone.testing</a> and\n<a href=\"http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.app.testing\">plone.app.testing</a>.</p>\n<p>plone.act will not disappear, but until we have agreed on where the\nrobot stuff for Plone should live, it may remain only as a development\nsandbox. Although, you can still checkout it (e.g. with\n<a href=\"http://pypi.python.org/pypi/mr.developer/\">mr.developer</a>), to use it in\ndevelopment and make internal releases out of it.</p>\n<p>Of course, also many other things were completed during the sprint, but\nI’m sure that there will be other reports focusing on them.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Overview of the new Robot Framework goodies for Plone","tags":["Plone","Robot Framework","Selenium","Testing"],"date":"February 11, 2013","published":"2013-02-11 06:00:00"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2013/02/overview-of-new-robot-framework-goodies.html/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2013/01/create-custom-views-for-dexterity-types.html/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Create custom views for Dexterity-types TTW"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2013/03/cross-browser-test-your-plone-add-on.html/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Cross-browser test your Plone add-on with Robot Framework, Travis-CI and Sauce Labs"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
