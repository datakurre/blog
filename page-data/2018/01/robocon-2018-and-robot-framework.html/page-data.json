It was a pleasure to be there, and I really\nfeel privileged that I was accepted there as a speaker.</p>\n<h2>My RoboCon 2018</h2>\n<p>RoboCon 2018 was a single day conference about Robot Framework test\nautomation ecosystem, held in the heart of Helsinki, Finland, on 18th of\nJanuary 2018. The conference venue was quite if not completely full, so\nthere must have been around 250 participants. The event was in English\nand had pretty good international participation. Yet, most of the\nparticipants came from Finland, where Robot Framework has become\nde-facto standard for test automation.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/85637047153687e74d3991590ccff504/LND_8D2D2079-6B5F-4DC1-A14C-6D30182A63FB.jpg\" alt=\"Pekka Klärck presenting the history, present and future of Robot\nFramework\"></p>\n<p>RoboCon 2018 had only a single track, so that had to be packed to\ninclude something for everyone in its diverse audience. In addition,\nthere was plenty of time and a separate space for networking with the\nother participants and conference sponsors. There was also organized\nsocial program before and after the conference, but unfortunately, I was\nunable to attend those at this time.</p>\n<p>In my opinion the program was well balanced: The conference started with\nintroductory talks, continued with variety of differnet case studies\n(Kone, Plone and Texas Instruments), and ended with more technical talks\nabout specific Robot Framework addons\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/robotframework/SeleniumLibrary\">SeleniumLibrary</a>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/asyrjasalo/RESTinstance\">the most awesome new REST\nlibrary</a> and\n<a href=\"https://github.com/mkorpela/pabot\">pabot</a>). And in the middle of\neverything, there was my personal favorite: Ed Manlove’s talk about\nbuilding successful open source communities. My presentation was called\n<a href=\"https://datakurre.github.io/robocon2018/index.html\">Robot Framework in Plone CMS\nProject</a>: a case\nstudy, story and some technical details, how Robot Framework got\nsuccessfully adopted in distributed open source community behind\n<a href=\"https://plone.com\">Plone</a>.</p>\n<p>The most important part of this conference, of course, was getting a lot\nof Robot Framework users and developers to meet in the same place at the\nsame time. After all, RoboCon 2018 was the first Robot Framework\nconference ever. My personal absolute highlight during the conference\nwas meeting a former Plonista, Ed Manlove. He was the one who first\nintroduced me to Selenium testing in San Francisco Plone Conference in\n2011, and whom I had not seen after that. Until now. I really hope takes\nless than seven yeras to see him again…</p>\n<p><img src=\"/0eef2ca356d996ceb354af42b1202cc5/IMG_6460.jpg\" alt=\"Ed Manlove presenting his talk: The Importance of Open Source\nCommunities\"></p>\n<h2>Jupyter kernel for Robot Framework</h2>\n<p>After the conference on Thursday came the single day conference sprint\non Friday. And if the conference was a success, the sprint was even more\nso: the sprint venue, three large office rooms, was packed full of\nsprinters, many of them participating their first open source sprint\n(and got a good introduction to open source development from Ed).</p>\n<p><img src=\"/b396cf12fe40aa9d98b394ae2374da09/IMG_6482.jpg\" alt=\"The sprint facilities were provided by\nEficode\"></p>\n<p>Because I had to leave early in Friday, I had planned a very specific\nsprint goal for myself: a MVP <a href=\"https://github.com/datakurre/robotkernel\">Robot Framework\nkernel</a> for Jupyter notebook.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://jupyter.org\">Jupyter</a> notebook (previously known as IPython\nnotebook) is an open-source web application for creating and sharing\ndocuments that contain live code, equations, visualizations and\nnarrative text. The architecture behind Jupyter notebook separates the\nnotebook application from its language specific “kernels” that are\nresponsible for executing the code in notebooks. Syntax highlighting in\nnotebooks, on the other hand, is provided by\n<a href=\"https://codemirror.net/\">CodeMirror</a> project for the interactive\nfrontend, and <a href=\"http://pygments.org/\">Pygments</a> for server side generated\nhighlighting.</p>\n<p>I’m happy to say that I made it. And the more I use it, the more\nconfident I get on that Jupyter makes a great platform for learning also\nRobot Framework. And not only for learning by yourself, but also for\nsharing your notes with others.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/datakurre/robotkernel/tree/master/examples/\">Check my example notebooks to judge the kernel by\nyourself.</a></p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/e0b73d3a6ab31f4a796c1a210b374b2c/2c5fd/Screenshot-2018-1-27%252BNotebook%252Bon%252Bnbviewer.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 158.78378378378378%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"image\"\n        title=\"image\"\n        src=\"/static/e0b73d3a6ab31f4a796c1a210b374b2c/fcda8/Screenshot-2018-1-27%252BNotebook%252Bon%252Bnbviewer.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/e0b73d3a6ab31f4a796c1a210b374b2c/12f09/Screenshot-2018-1-27%252BNotebook%252Bon%252Bnbviewer.png 148w,\n/static/e0b73d3a6ab31f4a796c1a210b374b2c/e4a3f/Screenshot-2018-1-27%252BNotebook%252Bon%252Bnbviewer.png 295w,\n/static/e0b73d3a6ab31f4a796c1a210b374b2c/fcda8/Screenshot-2018-1-27%252BNotebook%252Bon%252Bnbviewer.png 590w,\n/static/e0b73d3a6ab31f4a796c1a210b374b2c/efc66/Screenshot-2018-1-27%252BNotebook%252Bon%252Bnbviewer.png 885w,\n/static/e0b73d3a6ab31f4a796c1a210b374b2c/2c5fd/Screenshot-2018-1-27%252BNotebook%252Bon%252Bnbviewer.png 1006w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p><em>Please, note that while</em>\n<a href=\"http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/datakurre/robotkernel/tree/master/examples/\">theseexamples</a>\n<em>are static renderings at <a href=\"http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/\">http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/</a>, they can be\nopened and interacted live in any running Jupyter notebook with the new\nkernel and required Python packages. See the</em>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/datakurre/robotkernel\">repository</a> <em>for more\ndetails.</em></p>\n<p>The main Jupyter Robot Framework support features shown in <a href=\"http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/datakurre/robotkernel/tree/master/examples/\">those\nexamples</a>\nare:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Support for defining and executing Robot Framework test suite\ncumulatively step by step in successive notebook cells. The main\nlimitation is that each cell should start with a test suite section\nheader (settings, variables, keywords or test suites) even when the\nsame header was already defined in some cell before.</li>\n<li>HTML log and report files are linked below the executed cells\ncontaining the tests. Both files are actually bundled with the\nnotebook in a way that sharing the notebook also shares the log and\nreport files.</li>\n<li>Images generated during test execution are shown below the executed\ncells generating the images. Similarly to HTML logs and reports also\nimages are bundled with the notebook for sharing.</li>\n<li>Support for <code>%%python module LibaryName</code> “cell magic” to allow\ndefining custom Robot Framework keyword libraries in Python in fly.\nOnce thell cell with a Python library class definition is executed,\nit can be imported in a successive Robot Framework code cell.</li>\n<li>Syntax highlighting. But, unfortunately, until the CodeMirror plugin\nderived from <em>brackets-robotframework</em>-project is accepted into\nupstream, it must be manually patched into CodeMirror version\nshipped with Jupyter <em>notebook</em>-distribution. (I have not yet\nsubmitted a pull for it.)</li>\n<li>If the last keyword of the last test case in the executed cell\nreturns JSON string, it is rendered as cell execution output. I\nadded this quite specific feature to make it more fun to learn\nRESTinstance library with Jupyter (<em>Output</em> keyword of RESTinstance\nlibrary returns JSON).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Obviously, while the current versions is already fully functional on\nPython 3, there’s still a lot of work (QA, packaging and Python 2\nsupport) left to polish the code for release. I’m looking forward to\nfinish it during the spring.</p>\n<p>Happy hacking! And hopefully see you in RoboCon next year — or whenever\nit is organized and I’ll manage to participate it for the next time! :)</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"RoboCon 2018 and Robot Framework Jupyter support","tags":["Jupyter","Plone","Python","Robot Framework","Sprint"],"date":"January 27, 2018","published":"2018-01-27 06:00:00"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2018/01/robocon-2018-and-robot-framework.html/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2017/11/plone-conference-barcelona-2017.html/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Plone Conference Barcelona 2017"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2019/09/digital-signage-management.html/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Digital Signage management with Plone and GatsbyJS"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
