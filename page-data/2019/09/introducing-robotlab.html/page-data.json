For any issues with the installers, please, <a href=\"https://github.com/robots-from-jupyter/robotlab/issues\">file an issue</a>.</p>\n<p>RobotLab for Linux and MacOS ship with everything required to get started in <a href=\"https://robots-from-jupyter.github.io/robotkernel/notebooks/05%20Interactive%20Selenium.html\">Robot Framework powered Selenium testing</a>. RobotLab for Windows does not stop there, but also includes RobotFramework WhiteLibrary for <a href=\"https://robots-from-jupyter.github.io/robotkernel/notebooks/08%20Interactive%20WhiteLibrary.html\">Windows application testing and automation</a>. Ever seen a Windows automation experience like this? Maybe a bit geeky, but efficient:</p>\n<p><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zcrJirDX28I\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\"></iframe></div></p>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>In January 2018, the first Robot Framework conference was held in Helsinki, Finland. I wanted a fun topic for the sprints after the conference and started learning IPython kernel development. The very first version of <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/robotkernel/\">RobotKernel</a>, my Robot Framework IPython kernel for Jupyter integration, was working already before the end of the sprints:</p>\n<p><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kgLVioHZTgA\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\"></iframe></div></p>\n<p>Later in 2018, while I was too focused on other projects, Nicholas Bollweg found my RobotKernel and rebuilt its ideas and more into <a href=\"https://github.com/gtri/irobotframework\">irobotframework</a> Jupyter kernel for his employer. Once I learned from Nick about all the low hanging fruits I missed and the new features in <a href=\"https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\">JupyterLab</a>, I couldn’t resist returning to work on RobotKernel.</p>\n<p>Eventually, we decided to work together and propose a presentation and a workshop for the next RoboCon, in January 2019. Plan for the workshop, however, raised a question: How do we ensure that each participant of the workshop will have a working environment right from the start? Nick decided to solve that issue by building a standalone installer on top the shoulders of <a href=\"https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/\">Conda</a>.</p>\n<p>That installer become RobotLab. <a href=\"https://robots-from-jupyter.github.io/\">And now you can have it too.</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Introducing RobotLab","tags":["RobotLab","Robot Framework","Testing","RPA","Jupyter"],"date":"September 21, 2019","published":"2019-09-21 09:00:00"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2019/09/introducing-robotlab.html/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2019/09/digital-signage-management.html/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Digital Signage management with Plone and GatsbyJS"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2020/02/transmogrifier-revisited.html/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Creating Plone content with Transmogrifier on Python 3"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
