We\nhave had participation in Plone conferences in 2009, 2011–2012 and\n2014–2017, but for me the previous one was years ago: Plone Conference\nBristol in 2014. Needless to say that I have missed the warm and\nwelcoming atmosphere of a Plone conferences, and It’s my pleasure to\nreport that Barcelona did not let me down. Even the weather was still\nwarm there in this October.</p>\n<p>This year there was no single big Plone news at the conference. The\nlatest major release of Plone CMS was released already two years ago,\nand the next feature release is still waiting for its gold master. Yet,\nthere was still a lot of good news, and putting all the puzzle pieces\ntogether resulted in a clear picture of the future of Plone.</p>\n<p><em>Disclaimer: These are obviously just my personal opinions on all these\nthings Plone…</em></p>\n<p><em>Published originally at\n<a href=\"https://tech.blog.jyu.fi/2017/10/plone-conference-barcelona-2017.html/\">https://tech.blog.jyu.fi/2017/10/plone-conference-barcelona-2017.html/</a></em></p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/58205b15adfb7b0b66a854b05a23a6fe/b17f8/DMsDO13WsAAh3zG.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 100%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"image\"\n        title=\"image\"\n        src=\"/static/58205b15adfb7b0b66a854b05a23a6fe/1c72d/DMsDO13WsAAh3zG.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/58205b15adfb7b0b66a854b05a23a6fe/a80bd/DMsDO13WsAAh3zG.jpg 148w,\n/static/58205b15adfb7b0b66a854b05a23a6fe/1c91a/DMsDO13WsAAh3zG.jpg 295w,\n/static/58205b15adfb7b0b66a854b05a23a6fe/1c72d/DMsDO13WsAAh3zG.jpg 590w,\n/static/58205b15adfb7b0b66a854b05a23a6fe/a8a14/DMsDO13WsAAh3zG.jpg 885w,\n/static/58205b15adfb7b0b66a854b05a23a6fe/fbd2c/DMsDO13WsAAh3zG.jpg 1180w,\n/static/58205b15adfb7b0b66a854b05a23a6fe/b17f8/DMsDO13WsAAh3zG.jpg 1600w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p><em>Plone Conference Barcelona was so much of fun that I took a piece of it\nwith me back home.</em></p>\n<h2>Plone 2020 and beyond</h2>\n<p>At first, let’s say it clear that Plone CMS remains to be a safe bet\nfor a long-term enterprise CMS solution. If there ever was any doubt,\nwhether Plone could make it to Python 3 in-time before the end of Python\n2.7 maintenance in 2020, that should be no more. Plone will make it.</p>\n<p>All the major blockers seem to have been solved, and the rest is just\nhard work left for our community (check some related talks by\n<a href=\"https://2017.ploneconf.org/talks/doing-the-impossible\">Alexander</a> and\n<a href=\"https://2017.ploneconf.org/talks/zope-on-python-3\">Hanno</a> about the recent events on that). Python 3 version of Zope\napplication server powering Plone is already in beta, and it is\nscheduled to be released within a year. Plone, for sure, has still\nplenty of packages to be ported from Python 2.7 to Python 3, but there\nare already many sprints scheduled to continue that work in near future\n(including the already completed Barcelona Conference sprints). We might\neven have an alpha version of Plone on Python 3 before end of 2018.</p>\n<p>In addition that, it’s always good to mention, that Plone Foundation\nhas continued to do its usual great job in all the possible paper work\naround managing Plone’s copyrights and trademarks.</p>\n<p>All these should be good and relaxing news for any long-term Plone user.</p>\n<h2>Let’s go frontend!</h2>\n<p>The greatest challenge for Plone CMS seems to be keeping up with the\never increasing UX expections of the day, while complying with the high\naccessibility standards. After Plone 5 rewrote the default theme and\nwhole front-end resource management in Plone, there are no longer\nblockers for using any current front-end tech with Plone. But just being\nable to use some tech is not enough — also the real work for better UX\nneeds to be done. And even a lot has been done for Plone 5 and 5.1, that\nwork seems to never end.</p>\n<p>Plone Conference Barcelona included a great amount of front-end, user\nexperience and accessibility related talks to educate our community. So\nmany that I can only mention a few.</p>\n<p>At first, there were talks regarding the current Plone user interface:\n<a href=\"https://2017.ploneconf.org/talks/resource-registry-demystified\">Johannes</a> gave a bit technical, but very comprehensive talk how the new\nfrontend resource registries in Plone 5 really work. <a href=\"http://datakurre.pandala.org/2017/10/building-instant-features-with-advanced.html\">My\ntalk</a> instructed, how to combine the ancient powers of Zope\napplication server with the modern Plone 5 theming support to achieve\nshorter iterations and faster deployments when developing new UX\nfeatures. Our\n<a href=\"https://2017.ploneconf.org/talks/beyond-infinity-with-plone-5-are-we-there-yet\">Rikupekka</a> talked about our migration experiences from Plone 4 to Plone\n5, and gave a demo about of the UI features we have developed using the\napproach I discussed in my talk. Finally, I want to mention Wildcards’\n<a href=\"https://2017.ploneconf.org/talks/our-castles-strength\">Kim’s</a> talk about Castle CMS, which really showcased, how much\ndifference well lead and focused UX development for Plone based\ndistribution could do in just about a year. Although, the fact that\nCastle’s development had to be forked a bit from the main Plone\ndistribution is also telling, how difficult it is to make the same UX\nplease everyone.</p>\n<p>Then there were many talks about the future: there’s a new branch of\nPlone user interfaces built completely in JavaScript on top of the great\nPlone REST API (which\n<a href=\"https://2017.ploneconf.org/talks/building-bridges-the-headless-future-of-plone\">Timo</a> gave a nice presentation about). With Plone REST API it’s\npossible to combine the great and robust CMS features of our secure\nPlone backend with leading edge JavaScript based frontend. It also makes\nPlone based solutions feasible for the current generation of frontend\ndevelopers, because only very basic Plone knowledge is needed to get\nstarted. And while there is no complete replacement of Plone user\ninterface in JavaScript yet, there are SDK like projects with many\nfamiliar UI components already for\n<a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@plone%2Fplone-react\">ReactJS</a>,\n<a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@plone/restapi-angular\">Angular</a> (check\n<a href=\"https://2017.ploneconf.org/talks/this-is-2017-lets-go-frontend\">Eric’s</a> talk) and even on\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bierik/plone-vuejs\">VueJS</a>.</p>\n<p>If these don’t feel ambitious enough, there was one more thing:\n<a href=\"https://2017.ploneconf.org/talks/pastanaga-ui-resistance-is-futile\">Albert’s</a> talk about Pastanaga UI — a proposal for next generation UI\nfor generic CMSs.</p>\n<h2>Guillotina — server for a more civilized age</h2>\n<p>I’m not sure how common mistake it is, but at least we have sometimes\nended up using Plone as a framework for projects, for which Plone was\nnot really the most optimal solution. That has happened, because Plone\nhas some very unique features we love and trust: object database with\nURL traversal, extremely flexible Zope Component Architecture, and very\nproven security model especially designed for hierarchical data.</p>\n<p>At Barcelona conference,\n<a href=\"https://2017.ploneconf.org/talks/guillotina-the-asyncio-rest-resource-api\">Nathan</a> from Onna presented their new “AsyncIO REST Resource\nApplication Server” called Guillotina (open sourced through Plone\nFoundation)r What makes Guillotina very special and interesting is that\nit has all those unique features we have learned to love in Plone\n“framework”, but with minimal server footprint and first class support\nfor asynchronous programming using Python 3 AsyncIO event loop. That\nshould allow Guillotina to go places where no Plone has gone before.</p>\n<p>I really hope the next year brings us a suitable project to try\nGuillotina in practice…</p>\n<h2>There and back again</h2>\n<p>To summarize all this, here’s my picture of the future of Plone on the\nbase of Plone Conference Barcelona 2017 in three sentences:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Plone CMS as we know it remains here to stay — the current users\nremain safe with Plone</li>\n<li>Plone REST API and all the UI SDKs based on it “save Plone” by\nmaking it a feasible solution for content management related\nprogressive web apps</li>\n<li>Guillotina “saves Plone developers” by allowing them to transfer\ntheir current Plone “framework” knowledge into era of\nhigh-performance Python 3 AsyncIO microservices.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Obviously there was a lot more in the conference than this. There was a\nlot of great talks by talented speakers. It was great to see all the old\nfriends and make some new ones. I had a chance to meet my GSOC 2017\nstudent Oshane Bailey. And there are no parties like parties in Plone\nConferences.</p>\n<p>Thanks once again for all the organizers. It was a pleasure to be there.</p>\n<p>We’ll see if I get to see\n<a href=\"https://plone.org/news/2017/plone-conference-2018-will-be-in-tokyo-japan\">Tokyo</a> next year…</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/37e4108c6d56435a1f5d985092644fb0/e5166/DMlL1SzWsAM9mfO.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 56.08108108108109%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"image\"\n        title=\"image\"\n        src=\"/static/37e4108c6d56435a1f5d985092644fb0/1c72d/DMlL1SzWsAM9mfO.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/37e4108c6d56435a1f5d985092644fb0/a80bd/DMlL1SzWsAM9mfO.jpg 148w,\n/static/37e4108c6d56435a1f5d985092644fb0/1c91a/DMlL1SzWsAM9mfO.jpg 295w,\n/static/37e4108c6d56435a1f5d985092644fb0/1c72d/DMlL1SzWsAM9mfO.jpg 590w,\n/static/37e4108c6d56435a1f5d985092644fb0/a8a14/DMlL1SzWsAM9mfO.jpg 885w,\n/static/37e4108c6d56435a1f5d985092644fb0/fbd2c/DMlL1SzWsAM9mfO.jpg 1180w,\n/static/37e4108c6d56435a1f5d985092644fb0/e5166/DMlL1SzWsAM9mfO.jpg 1200w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p><em>Photo of me, Oshane Bailey and David Bain by Maik Derstappen.
